To develop front end:

* React *

- navigate to app/eic
- if you just cloned the repo, you may need to run `npm install` to build in the required dependencies
- run `node server.js`
- open new window and navigate to app/eic
- run `npm run start` after changes to front-end codebase
  then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ if this is not already 
  done for you

- run `npm run build` when satisfied with changes in order
  to create production build to be served from build/ as index.html
- after this step, navigating to http://localhost:8080/ 
  without the react server running (still running node 
  server) should serve the built front end.

* Sass *
- Install compass (and ruby)
- navigate to app/eic/public
- run `compass watch .`
- as you make changes to _main.scss compass with compile sass/ to css/
