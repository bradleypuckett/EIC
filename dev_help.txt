To develop front end:

- navigate to app/eic
- run `node server.js`
- open new window and navigate to app/eic
- run `npm run start` after changes to front-end codebase
  then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ if this is not already done for you

- run `npm run build` when satisfied with changes in order to create production build to be served from build/ as index.html
-after this step, navigating to http://localhost:8080/ without the react server running (still running node server) should serve the built front end.
